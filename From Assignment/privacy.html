    <h1>Basic info concerning Godfrey</h1>
    <h2>Hope you brought popcorns for this</h2>
    <p> Hi Mr Adewale my name is Godfrey am from akwa ibom state, Nigeria<br>
    Born and rised in lagos state. Am the only son of my family,I'm a very soft hearted and careing person.
   <br><b>My life before Altschool was hectic</b> i use to be a baker so i barely had time for myself.
   <br><i>I joined altschool so i could become an software engineer that's always been my dream since i was a kid</i>
   <br><em>aspiration for venturing into tech is to one day amount someon<br><u> 
    and to make my elder sis so proud cause the believe she has in me is beyond</u> </em>
    <br> Am so glad for coming across Altschool and the experience i have gotten to learn here,<br> 
    But although i know am still struggling now cause i still do lots of other works which takes my time <br>
    And making me lack behind but i believe am picking up soon. <br>
    I believe am going to be one of the best graduating student from this program. <br>
    I know it going to get more difficult i'm ready for all the hardship that follows <br>
    Thank you AltSchool for this opportunity to be here' <br>
